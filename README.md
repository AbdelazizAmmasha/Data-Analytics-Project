# Data-Analytics-Project
I analyzed the dataset derived from network traffic simulations to identify patterns associated with different types of network attacks, such as Blackhole, Flooding, and Selective Forwarding. I used machine learning models with feature selection techniques in predictive analytics and Genetic Algorithms and PSO in prescriptive analytics.
